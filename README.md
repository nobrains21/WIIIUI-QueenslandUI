Skin is based on QueenslandUI, made by [i3lackdeath](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/members/i3lackdeath.169700/), for Warcraft 3.
All credits for the art i used to make this skin should go to him. I own none of it and will remove this if promted.

# Installation
- Download the whole thing and unpack it somewhere;
- Move the custom1 folder in to **Interface\AddOns\WIIIUI\art**;
- Open addon menu in game and click on the Custom1 button to apply it;
 
In case you already have custom skins installed - change folder's name from **custom1** to **custom#**, where **#** is a number from 2-8, which is not currently used.
 
Feel free to bash me for leaving some unfinished stuff here and there.
