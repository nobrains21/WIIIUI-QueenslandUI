Skin is based on QueenslandUI, made by [i3lackdeath](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/members/i3lackdeath.169700/), for Warcraft 3.
All credits for the art i used to make this skin should go to him. I own none of it and will remove this if promted.

# Installation
- Download [WIIIUI Addon](https://github.com/Fiurs-Hearth/WIIIUI) and install it;
- Click on the green "Code" button up top and choose "Download Zip";
- Download and unpack the archive. Find **custom1** folder inside.
- Move the custom1 folder in to **\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\WIIIUI\art**;
- Open addon menu in game and click on the Custom1 button to apply it;
 
In case you already have custom skins installed - change folder's name from **custom1** to **custom#**, where **#** is a number from 2-8, which is not currently used.
 
Feel free to bash me for leaving some unfinished stuff here and there. 
 
#Known issues:
- the long middle bar is a bit wonky - its just is. It overlaps with itself in a way my small brain cannot predict/understand. Sorry.
- there is a gap between the Lid and most right side of the chat-field. No idea why.
- there are white dots here and there, especialy at places i edited. In some cases i managed to get it crispy clear, but not everywhere. I need to up my MS-PAint skills. Sorry.
